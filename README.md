# reddit-comment-delete
Shitty little program that deletes comments on reddit - have to provide username and password, pretty slow but it worked for me

Follow selenium installation instructions here - https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html

  - Selenium browser automated comment deleter
  - Deletes a comment every 0.2 seconds (can probably be faster but was too fast for the browser without a limit)
  - code is pretty terrible
  - If errors come up halfway through deleting just rerun the program
